# Exploring-NYC-Public-School-Test-Result-Scores
## Problem Statement :question:
Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.
Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend.
You have been provided with a dataset called schools.csv, which is previewed below.
You have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.

## These analytical steps I have followed to solve this problem :white_check_mark:
* Load the CSV file and store as schools.
* Subset the data to find the schools with math scores of at least 80%, considering the maximum possible score is 800 and save this as a pandas DataFrame called best_math_schools.
* Find the 10 best performing schools based on the total score across the three SAT sections.
* Find out the number of schools, average SAT, and standard deviation of SAT for the NYC borough with the largest standard deviation, rounded to two decimal places.

## Technologies Used :man_technologist:
* Python
* Pandas
* Numpy
